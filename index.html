    <p>
Having a very good understanding of advertising, photo manipulation, typography and knowledge of the web, I am always pushing my boundaries and being daring. Being a self-starter and having a “can do” attitude, I like challenges and love to explore new things.
I am very motivated, commited and loyal. Having stud- ied leadership, I was able to develop the skills to be- come more e cient and also more productive in time management and meeting deadlines while keeping an open mind to last minute change without damaging the end result. Being hard working, dedicated, friendly and meticulous, I believe I would  t right in.
    </p>
<p>Originating from Mauritius, I went to Australia in 2008 and studied leadership for 2 years and work for another 1.5 years before coming to Switzerland with my wife. Then I studied Graphic design while working as a Barista, at  first and got promoted to Shift Supervisor after a month. While studying and working, I was also doing some freelancing job in graphic design. Having  finished my studies, I am looking to work for a company where I can put my skills to use and push the company forward. Being hard working, dedicated, friendly and meticulous, I believe I would  t right in and be part of a team like yours where I would be able to grow and explore new areas. Every project, every client and every challenge are not the same and these are things that really reveal your values and character.</p>Currently I am learning Programming to push my skills to the next level.<p>
Thank you for your time and looking forward to hear from you soon.</p>
</p>Sincerely yours,</p><p>Jonathan Hector</p>
